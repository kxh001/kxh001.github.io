From the explosive rise of score-based models and DDPM[], to DDIM[], EDM[], and now Flow-based models[], the field has advanced at breakneck speed over the past three years. Currently, most mainstream open-source models—such as SD3[] and FLUX[] — have adopted the Flow-based framework as their foundation. To meet the growing demand for high-resolution generation, diffusion models are commonly paired with VAEs to operate in the latent space, leading to architectures like LDM. Meanwhile, the DiT backbone (and its variants) has become the de facto standard for model architecture. Training typically follows a multi-stage approach: starting with a rough, general-purpose model pre-trained on massive datasets, followed by more focused fine-tuning on curated data.</p> <p>Overall, the pre-training phase for these models is largely complete. The key question now is how to best leverage these sophisticated models for a wide range of downstream tasks—where post-training will play an increasingly central role. This blog post explores how information theory offers a fresh perspective on both the pre-training and post-training of diffusion models, enabling them to become more interpretable and effective.</p> <h1 id="bridging-diffusion-and-information-theory">Bridging Diffusion and Information Theory</h1> <p>The connection between diffusion models and information theory is both profound and practical. For example, the MMSE (minimum mean squared error) estimator naturally leads to an optimal denoiser, and is directly linked to the pointwise KL divergence between the conditional and unconditional distributions of noised data.</p> <h1 id="infor-for-pre-training">Infor for Pre-training</h1> <p>Leveraging this bridge between diffusion and information theory, we can derive a loss function that enables precise estimation of the negative log-likelihood (NLL) via denoising. This approach offers a principled and theoretically sound objective for model training.</p> <h1 id="infor-for-post-training">Infor for Post-training</h1> <p>Information theory also plays a crucial role in post-training, particularly in enhancing alignment and compositionality. By providing a rigorous foundation for guiding and refining model behavior, it enables more interpretable and controllable generative models. Recent work in my information-theoretic diffusion framework demonstrates promising advances in this direction.</p> <h1 id="infor-for-evaluation">Infor for Evaluation</h1> <p>When it comes to evaluation, information theory expands our toolkit beyond standard metrics like loss, FID, or CLIP score. For example, visualizing the MMSE gap provides intuitive diagnostics: it becomes much easier to spot issues in model training at specific timesteps and to compare models in terms of how accurately they estimate the true data density. Moreover, with an accurate, theoretically motivated objective, we can evaluate models using precise NLL values—something that FID and CLIP scores often fail to provide reliably or align with human perception. Mutual information, in particular, offers a solid theoretical basis for developing robust multimodal evaluation criteria.</p> <h1 id="infor-for-latent-space-curation">Infor for Latent Space Curation</h1> <p>I am especially interested in designing information-theoretic approaches for curating the latent space. This is essential for achieving controllable, high-resolution generation, and is often the key to overcoming challenges in generating realistic layered images.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="AutoRegressive"/><category term="Diffusion"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the rapid evolution of diffusion models, the underlying theoretical frameworks have been constantly shifting—even as they remain deeply interconnected.

In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
