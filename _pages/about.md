I'm currently a Video GenAI Researcher at [Voia](https://voia.com). I was a CS Ph.D. student, worked with the incredible ✨ [Prof. Greg Ver Steeg](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/gregoryv) ✨ at the University of California, Riverside. Fortunately, I also worked at `SonyAI`(Host: [Vikash Sehwag](https://vsehwag.github.io/)) and `Adobe Firefly` (Host: [Hareesh Ravi](https://hareesh-ravi.github.io/)) as a Research Intern.

My research centers on **Generative Models** (Diffusion Models & Energy-Based Models), with a focus on their **interpretability**, **alignment**, and **compositionality**. Specifically, I explore diffusion models through a novel information-theoretic lens, termed [Information-Theoretic Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03792) (ITD) ℹ️. Our work demonstrates how [Pointwise Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07972) (PMI) enhances compositional reasoning and modality alignment (e.g., text and image). We are actively expanding the ITD universe 🌌 and welcome collaboration opportunities!

Prior to UCR, I focused on EEG data analysis in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) 🧠 technology, bridging neuroscience and computer science. Outside of research, I enjoy exploring food, sketching, and visiting museums.
