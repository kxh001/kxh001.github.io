I am a final-year CS Ph.D. student working with the incredible âœ¨ [Prof. Greg Ver Steeg](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/gregoryv) âœ¨ at the University of California, Riverside. I was an intern at <img src="/assets/icons/adobe_logo.png" alt="Adobe" class="icon"> Adobe Firefly and <img src="/assets/icons/sonyai_logo.png" alt="Sony AI" class="icon"> SonyAI. 

My research centers on **Generative Models** (Diffusion Models & Energy-Based Models), with a focus on their **interpretability**, **alignment**, and **compositionality**. Specifically, I explore diffusion models through a novel information-theoretic lens, termed [Information-Theoretic Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03792) (ITD). Our work demonstrates how [Pointwise Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07972) (PMI) enhances compositional reasoning and modality alignment (e.g., text and image). We are actively expanding the ITD universe ðŸŒŒ and welcome collaboration opportunities! 

Prior to UCR, I focused on EEG data analysis in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) ðŸ§  technology, bridging neuroscience and computer science. Outside of research, I enjoy exploring SoCal's food scene, sketching, and visiting museums.
